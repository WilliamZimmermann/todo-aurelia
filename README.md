# todo-aurelia

This code is based in the Todo Tutorial from Aurelia Website: https://aurelia.io/docs/tutorials/creating-a-todo-app#

I'm using Typescript.

To run the code, just type: « http-server -o -c-1 »

If it doesn't run, try to install NPM and the follow code:
« npm install http-server -g »

Maybe will be necessary to give "sudo" permissions.
